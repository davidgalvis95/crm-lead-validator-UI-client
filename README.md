### How to use this client

**_THIS CLIENT REQUIRES NVM(NODE VERSION MANAGER) AND NODE TO BE INSTALLED IN YOUR LOCAL MACHINE_**

1) Run `npm install` in the **crm-validator-client (root)** folder
2) Run "npm start" to view the project
3) to validate a customer do not forget to have the crm-lead-validator api running
4) When running it go to `http://localhost:3000/` to view the client
5) Search in the` Search by Id `textbox using the lead id, and if you want to make it a sample record, make click on the `Is Sample lead` green check icon, if the icon is bigger than before it means that is a sample record, otherwise it is not. Select it back to make it not a sample lead.
6) The client will start searching _**if you stop typing for a while**_, and your input _**is a number of 9 digits**_, otherwise you will see a popup asking you to pass the correct input.
7) That's it, enjoy it! :)
